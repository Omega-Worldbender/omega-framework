# Noob Guide: Running the Ω-Framework Code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- numpy library

## Installation (5 minutes)

### Windows:
```bash
# Install Python from python.org
# Open Command Prompt
pip install numpy
```

### Mac:
```bash
# Install Python from python.org or use brew
pip3 install numpy
```

### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install numpy
```

## Running the Code
```bash
# Navigate to code folder
cd code

# Run the program
python derive_with_math_FINAL.py

# You'll see a menu:
# 1. Calculate electron mass
# 2. View all constants
# 3. Show methodology
# etc...

# Try option 1 first!
```

## What You'll See

The program calculates the electron mass from pure mathematics:
- Input: Only π and e
- Process: Ω-framework equations
- Output: 0.510364 MeV/c²
- Compare to measured: 0.511000 MeV/c²
- Error: 0.124%

## Understanding the Output

[Include screenshot or example output]

## Problems?

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- Your Python version (`python --version`)
- Error message
- Operating system
