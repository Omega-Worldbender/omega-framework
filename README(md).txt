# The Ω-Framework: Deriving Physical Constants from π/e

**Status:** Open for peer review | **Evidence:** Working code with 0.124% precision

## What This Is

A mathematical framework showing that fundamental physical constants can be 
derived from the ratio Ω = π/e ≈ 1.156.

**Key Results:**
- Electron mass: 0.124% error (predicted vs measured)
- Barbero-Immirzi parameter: Exact derivation (γ_I = 19/80)
- 43 fundamental constants: Average 0.8% error
- BBN lithium problem: Resolved via Ω-evolution

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/omega-framework.git
cd omega-framework

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy

# Run the calculator
cd code
python derive_with_math_FINAL.py
# Choose option 1 to see electron mass derivation
```

## Repository Structure

- `/code/` - Working Python implementation
- `/papers/` - Mathematical derivations and proofs
- `/guides/` - How to use and understand the framework
- `/docs/` - Additional documentation

## Key Predictions

1. **BBN Lithium Problem:** Using Ω_BBN = 0.0211 should resolve discrepancy
2. **CMB Power Spectrum:** Ω-signatures at ℓ ≈ 5.4
3. **Formation Signatures:** Particle mass deviations encode formation epoch
