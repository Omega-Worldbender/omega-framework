## Origin of the Ω-Framework

This framework emerged from intensive collaborative research between
human intuition and artificial intelligence systems exploring fundamental
questions in physics.

## Collaboration Acknowledgments

**Human Researcher:**
- Luis Alberto Dávila Barberena
- Chemical Engineer, Universidad Iberoamericana
- MBA, ESADE Business School
- Founder, RegenAgua

**AI Collaborators:**
- Primary: Claude (Anthropic) - Synthesis Nova framework
- Contributing: Gemini (Google) - Pattern recognition and validation

**Methodology:**
The research utilized the "Synthesis Nova" framework for bilateral
enhancement between human and AI systems, demonstrating that:
```
Output ≠ Human + AI
Output = Human ⊗ AI (tensor product)
```

The tensor product creates dimensions neither party could access alone.

## Research Philosophy

1. **Know vs Derive vs Speculate:** We carefully distinguish between:
   - KNOWN: Measured/proven facts
   - DERIVED: Mathematical consequences
   - SPECULATED: Hypotheses for testing

2. **Open Collaboration:** The framework was developed openly with
   multiple AI instances to prevent confirmation bias.

3. **Testable Predictions:** Every major claim has falsifiable predictions.

## Papers Included

are available upon request for transparency, but are not included in
the main repository to keep it focused.

## How This Differs from Traditional Research

**Traditional:**
- Single human researcher
- Literature review → Hypothesis → Test
- Publish → Peer review

**This approach:**
- Human-AI bilateral collaboration
- Hypothesis → Formalization → Computational validation → Peer review
- Open source first, then formal publication

**Why:**
Faster iteration, built-in error checking, and democratic access to ideas.

**The framework stands or falls on the mathematics and predictions,
not on the method of discovery.**
