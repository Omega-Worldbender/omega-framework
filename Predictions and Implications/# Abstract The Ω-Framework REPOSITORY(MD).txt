# Abstract: The Ω-Framework

## One-Paragraph Summary

We demonstrate that fundamental physical constants can be derived from 
the transcendental ratio Ω = π/e ≈ 1.1557. This framework resolves the 
Barbero-Immirzi parameter as γ_I = 19/80 (exactly), predicts particle 
masses with <1% error, and offers resolution to the BBN lithium problem 
via cosmic Ω-evolution. The approach yields 43 constants with average 
0.8% error and makes testable predictions for CMB observations and 
cosmological structure formation.

## Key Results

- Electron mass: 0.5103640952 MeV/c² (predicted) vs 0.5109989500 MeV/c² 
  (measured) = 0.124% error
- 26 exact matches (0% error)
- BBN lithium: Ω_BBN = 0.0211 resolves factor-of-3 discrepancy
- Ω-evolution: Ω(t) = π × exp(1 - 1/γ(t)) from 0 → π/e → π

## Testable Predictions

1. Complete BBN recalculation with Ω_BBN = 0.0211
2. CMB power spectrum signatures at ℓ ≈ 5.4
3. Quasar spectroscopy for α-variation
4. Atomic clock constraints on ∂Ω/∂t
5. High-z structure decay rates

## Methodology

Mathematical derivation from first principles + computational validation 
via Python implementation (included in repository).

## Status

**Open for peer review.** We seek validation, criticism, and collaboration.
