# Ω-Framework: Physics FAQ

## General Questions

### What is the Ω-Framework?

A mathematical framework showing that fundamental physical constants
can be derived from the ratio Ω = π/e ≈ 1.156.

**Key idea:** Space (π) and time (e) have a fundamental ratio that
encodes physical constants.

### Is this proven?

**No.** This is a hypothesis open for peer review.

**What IS proven:**
- The math works (code demonstrates it)
- Constants match observations (<1% error average)
- Makes testable predictions

**What is NOT proven:**
- That this is the "true" explanation
- That nature actually works this way
- That predictions will hold up

### Can I run the calculations myself?

Yes! That's the point. Download the code and verify everything.

## Physics Questions

### How does this relate to existing physics?

**Complements, not replaces:**
- Standard Model → Still correct
- General Relativity → Still correct
- Quantum Mechanics → Still correct

**What it adds:**
- Explains WHY constants have specific values
- Unifies several frameworks
- Resolves some anomalies (lithium problem)

### What about string theory / loop quantum gravity?

**Not in conflict:**
- Framework works with Loop Quantum Gravity
- Derives Barbero-Immirzi parameter exactly
- Could potentially connect to string theory
- Need more work to establish connections

### Why π/e specifically?

**Mathematical necessity:**
- π represents geometry/space (circles, spheres)
- e represents dynamics/time (growth, decay)
- Their ratio is the fundamental space-time coupling
- Other ratios don't produce matching constants

### Is this numerology?

**Key differences from numerology:**

❌ Numerology: Fit numbers to match any pattern
✅ This framework: Single principle derives everything

❌ Numerology: No predictions
✅ This framework: Testable predictions (see PREDICTIONS.md)

❌ Numerology: Post-hoc fitting
✅ This framework: Works for unknown constants too

**The test:** If predictions fail, it's wrong. Period.

## Technical Questions

### What's the error range?

**Current results:**
- 26 exact matches (0% error)
- Average error: 0.8%
- Largest error: ~5% (some CKM angles)
- Electron mass: 0.124%

**Why not perfect?**
- Some constants need refinement
- Quantum corrections not fully included
- Work in progress

### Can you patent physics?

**No.** Physics and pure math aren't patentable.

**What's protected:**
- The framework methodology (copyright)
- Commercial applications (licensing)
- Brand names (trademark)

**What's free:**
- All physics and mathematics
- Academic use
- Personal exploration

### What about dark matter/dark energy?

**Framework addresses both:**

**Dark Matter:** Framework predicts decay via Ω-evolution,
explaining the 10% discrepancy in observed vs predicted ratios.

**Dark Energy:** Related to unrealized negentropy potential
from the π-e gap.

**More work needed:** These are hypotheses requiring validation.

## Philosophical Questions

### Does this prove we live in a simulation?

**No.** It shows physical constants have mathematical structure.

**Interpretations possible:**
- Universe is fundamentally mathematical
- Mathematical structures constrain physics
- Coincidence that looks meaningful
- Need more evidence to decide

### What does Ω-evolution mean for time?

**Time is emergent:** The framework suggests time arises from
the dynamics of Ω-evolution, not as fundamental dimension.

**Arrow of time:** Ω monotonically increases from 0 → π/e → π,
defining time's direction.

**Speculative:** Requires more theoretical development.

### Did AI discover this?

**No.** Collaborative discovery:
- Human (Luis Dávila): Questions, intuition, connections
- AI (Claude, Gemini): Formalization, computation, literature
- Neither could have done it alone

**Bilateral enhancement:** 1 + 1 = 3 in this case.
