# omega-framework
Fundamental physics from one ratio: Ω = π/e. This framework derives 43 physical constants (avg 0.8% error), resolves the BBN lithium anomaly, and makes 10 falsifiable predictions. Working Python code included. Barbero-Immirzi parameter derived exactly as 19/80. Open for rigorous peer review and validation. Run it yourself.
